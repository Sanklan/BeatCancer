# BeatCancer
Project BeatCancer is in planning stage.(Draft)
### Objective
My father is recently discovered GI cancer of Advanced stage. He had Gall bladder removal surgery few years back to that. On talking on some support facebook groups and few people in person, they had the same medical history.

The term 'Cancer', actually consist of more than 100 diseases. There is no specific reason why it occurs. 
 Like my father's case, it is a repeated history. Many patient already went through the same thing. Sometime I though whatif I had known about it earlier, whatif we had went through PET-CT six month post Gall-bladder surgery, we could have caught it in its 2nd or 1st stage(Assuming GB surgery is linked to cancer).
 > This project is created with objective to prevent Cancer or help with early detection of Cancer using data science.
    
## Plan
### 10000Ft high
- Collect data of individuals(with Cancer & without Cancer)
- Create a pattern finding algorithms(basically Machine learning models which can detect patterns as well as most influential vectors)
- generate report, share with the world and doctor & other researchers for input
#### Patterns
I heard a lot of people saying 'vegetables grown with use Pesticide are responsible for Gastro-Intestinal Cancer' or 'use of plastic containers for hot food or water is responsible for cancer'. Well, they all can be myth ot can be true.
    The patterns that I am looking which can gives us 2 things 
   - Something that we are doing wrong routinely which leads to it
   - Some medical issues which can be red flags for the same. Like Gall-bladder problem in father's case(Although this is not medically proven).

#### Influential Vector
Vectors in data science are independent variables. By influential vector, I mean to find most influential reasons on why cancer
